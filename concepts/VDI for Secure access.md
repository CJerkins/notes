What is VDI,  **Virtual Desktop Instances**, and how do we use it today. VDI is simply and virtual machine within a hypervisor housed on a server rack or cloud instance that you are able to remote into and use as if it was on your laptop. VDI technology is currently a widely used techonology through-out in areas such as the Public Health, Government, Military, and Commerial sectors. 

VDI technology can benefit the SOF Comms enterprise by providing a secure, data-at-rest protected, on an array of platforms. Currently to access different platforms you are required to have provide a device for each seperate network. This means if you require to have access to 2-3 networks, you will have 3-4 devices that function simularly to access each network. This has become very cumbersome and brings scrutney to those traveling cross borders. 

In the following, the solution being presented will solve several problems currently hindering effeciant communications by decreasing the amount of devices required to connect various network. Depending on your mobility requirements, you will only need 1-2 managed devices. The devices consist of a laptop or mobile phone, and if required a hockey puc sized travel router. The devices would not require any special operating system from DoD or NSA to connect to the VDI, and the only requirement will be the devices to be managed by a MDM (Mobile Device Management) system. This is to ensure the device connecting to the VDI network is complying to security standards and has not been comprimized. Next the user will need to have thier creditials via CAC or security key and username password which activates which connects them via VPN and grants access to VDI network to remote into. This solution will seem all to simiple for the user which may appear unsecure to them but this solution pulls the complexity of a secure connection out of the users hands and places it squarly on the backend.
