The data island concept is to bring a self contained enterprise grade intenet connectivity and network security to the teamhouse. Often during decentalized training operations the team don't have access to or secure internet connection to where they are at. Usually left to either connect to uncertian networks and slow connection speeds. 

The solution presented has 3 main components to solves this problem. First is a multi-wan device that can connect via LTE/4G/3G, ethernet, or WiFi. Second is a enterprise grade firewall with advance threat prevention and detection software. Third is an enterprise grade WiFi connectivity. All components runs off of an intergrated backup battery incase of an outages. The solution is self contained within a hard stackable carrying case.
