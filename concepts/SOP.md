# SC SOP and Techniques

## Understand the 4 Pillars that make it SC

### Unassociate funding for digital communication services, equipment, research, and development
- Funding sources matches mission sensitivity. 
- Funding for SC projects are dedicated with special purppose for specific mission sets. 
- Funding for one size fits all approuch seldomly can support higher levels of sensitivity.
- As mentioned in the title, the funding for the project pretains to all stages of the in the fielding of SC

### Obfuscate where the device or parts is acquired
- Technicial equipment at a minium should be aquired from locations that make it difficult to coralate trackable purchase or manufacture location to operating unit or user.
- Purchase at operating location if possible is best.
- Be aware where the majority of the software the operator is using is developed.

### Obfuscate the Device's digital location (Point of presences)
- Change di

### Compartmentalize activities (Person vs work)

## Comms from A to B
- NSC/SC comms should not have a standardizes procedure or TTP. 
	- Divirsity between unit is your best cyber defense over an organization. This negates the advisary's to copy paste thier cyber offence and digital dectection capibilities. 
	- Comms defense solutions should be designed to be resource intensive for the advisary, not for the user.
- Follow the pillars as a guideline in development of your PACE plan.
- Build your threat.
- PACE plan development should be intensive and detailed. Segregate the areas of possible failure. Some areas of concern to consider;
	- Device
	- Software
	- Data transport (VPNs/TLS)
	- Methods of uplink
	- Methods of security layers
	- Point of presense
- HINT: Just because you may require a range of software and devices, does not mean you need to carry all of it on your person. Think of it as tools in a toolbox.
