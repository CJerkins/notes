# About

AREDN wireless networks are deployed by licensed Amateur Radio operators, Technician Class or higher, under FCC Part 97 allocations adjacent to FCC part 15, unlicensed, WIFI, allocations. They are configured as ad-hoc nodes to form mesh networks. The firmware created below enables the effective use of valuable and dedicated frequencies for communication services to government and private relief organizations in times of disaster or other emergencies.

Amateur Radio frequencies are relatively clean of noise from the commercial allocations and ensure usability for Amateur Radio Operators. This firmware enables 802.11n wireless networks to be created and expanded with minimal to no pre-planning or IT expertise. A user can deploy a 'node' anywhere to connect in and extend an AREDN network. Device hardware options exist to provide sector coverage, build point-to-point links, and connect end point services to the network. High speed link rates are routinely achieved over long distances, e.g. 60Mbps+ on 10MHz channels over 80km links.
